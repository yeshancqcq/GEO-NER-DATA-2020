# GEO-NER-DATA-2020
An NER (named entity recognition) dataset for geoscience semi-manually annotated. It contains abstracts of all _articles_ published in and before 2020 on the following journals:
- _Nature Geoscience_
- _Geology_
- _Earth and Planetary Science Letters_


Data source: Scopus
Labelled entities:

- **LOC**: geographic locations, current and past (e.g., United States, eastern China, Michigan, Arctic Canada, Yangtze River, Pacific Ocean, Nazca Plate, Rocky Mountains, New York City, Gondwana...)
- **TIME**: geological intervals or specific events (e.g. Precambrian, Cretaceous, Eocene, K-Pg event, Last Glacial Maximum, PETM, OAEs...)
- **LITH**: rock types (e.g. limestone, igneous rock, metasedimentary rock, mafic rock, basalt, slate, marble...)
- **MINERAL**: minerals (e.g. quartz, feldspar, plagioclase, opal...)
- **PROC**: geological processes (e.g. transgression, uplifting, earthquake, weathering, calving, orogeny...)
- **PLANET**: planetary terms (e.g. plate tectonics, mantle, mantle convection, atmosphere, asthenosphere...)
- **FEAT**: geological features (e.g. fold, fault, syncline, thrust, fjord, abyssal plain, foreland basin, xenolith, tidal flat, alluvial fan, moraine, lagoon...)
- **STRAT**: strata names (e.g. Hell Creek Formation, Morrison Formation, Dakota Sandstone, Mancos Shale, Fiftymile Member...)


_Note: The dataset may still need more rounds of check._
